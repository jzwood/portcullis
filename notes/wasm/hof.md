 Snek: Expressing higher-order functions in WebAssembly currently involves a more manual process compared to higher-level languages like JavaScript or Python, as WebAssembly itself lacks direct support for higher-order functions due to its low-level nature. However, higher-order functions can still be implemented indirectly.

Here's a generalized way you might implement higher-order functions in WebAssembly:

Function Table: You'll typically use a function table, an indirect function call mechanism that WebAssembly provides. Functions are referenced by their index in this table, which allows you to call functions indirectly through these indices.

Pass Function Indices: Instead of passing functions directly (like you might in JavaScript), you pass the index of the function you want to use as a callback or as an argument to another function.

Indirect Calls: Use the call_indirect instruction, which allows calling a function indirectly through its index in the function table.

Language-Specific Compilation: If you're using a language that compiles to WebAssembly, often the compiler will handle some of this for you. For example, compiling Rust to WebAssembly, the Rust compiler will handle the creation of function tables and the use of call_indirect when you use higher-order functions in Rust.

External JavaScript: If WebAssembly is being used in a web browser, JavaScript can also manage higher-order functions. WebAssembly functions could be exported to JavaScript, which then uses its native support for higher-order functions to pass those functions back into WebAssembly as arguments where needed.

Linear Memory: Sometimes, you might manage higher-order functions by using a combination of linear memory (shared between JavaScript and WebAssembly) to store additional context needed for the function calls.

Here's a simplified conceptual example using WebAssembly Text Format (WAT):

 ```
(module
  (table 1 anyfunc)
  (memory (export "memory") 1)

  (func $add (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32)
    (i32.add (get_local $a) (get_local $b))
  )

  (func $subtract (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32)
    (i32.sub (get_local $a) (get_local $b))
  )

  (func $applyFunction (param $funcIndex i32) (param $a i32) (param $b i32) (result i32)
    (call_indirect (type $binaryFunc) (get_local $a) (get_local $b) (get_local $funcIndex))
  )

  (elem (i32.const 0) $add $subtract)

  (type $binaryFunc (func (param i32) (param i32) (result i32)))
)
```

 Snek: In this example, there are two functions $add and $subtract, which you can call indirectly using $applyFunction with their indices as arguments, demonstrating a rudimentary higher-order function setup in WebAssembly.

Please note that to use this kind of functionality effectively, one would generally need to understand both the WebAssembly language and the mechanism for whichever language they are using that compiles to WebAssembly.
